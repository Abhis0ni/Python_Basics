Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
- Python is an interpreted,object oriented programming language.It is used for different variety of development tasks and in fields like artificial intelligence,ML etc.It is easy to learn,read and understand for humans as compared to other programming languages that is why we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language. 


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
- In Python, there is no need to define types of variables and the type is determined only during runtime. This is why Python is called a dynamically typed language.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
- Advantages:
1) Easy to read,learn and write
2) Interpreted language
3) Dynamically typed
4) Free and open source
5) Vast varity of libraries support
6) Portability
- Disadvantages:
1) Slow speed of execution
2) Not memory efficient
3) Weak in mobile computing and browsers
4) Underdeveloped database access layers


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
- Python can be used in following domains
1) Machine learning
2) Artificial Intelligence
3) Desktop GUI
4) Game development
5) Data analytics
6) Data visualization
7) Embedded systems


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
- Variable is container which store values and used to perform different operations.Python is a dynamic typed language, which means we don't need to mention the variable type or declare before using it. Type is determined only during runtime.
Some examples to declare variables are below
x= 3.99   # Float type
X= 10     # Integer type
y= True   # Boolean type
z= "SQL"  # String type


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
- In Python, we ahve a function input() to take input data from user at runtime.
 Num1 = int(input("Please enter No.: "))
 Name = input("Please enter name: ")


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
- The default datatype of input() function is str.


Q8. What is type casting?
- The process of converting the value of one data type to another data type is called type casting.
  e.g a = int("123") # Type casting datatype string '123' to int


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
- Yes we can. We have a split() function in Python. Below is the example
x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
print("Number of boys: ", x)
print("Number of girls: ", y)



Q10. What are keywords?
- Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.Some of the examples are import,or,and,while,if,elif,else.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
- No, we can not use keywords as a variable because these are reserved for specific purposes.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
- Indentation in Python refers to the whitespaces at the start of the line. We can create indentation using space or tabs. When writing Python code, we have to define a group of statements for functions and loops. This is done by properly indenting the statements for that block.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
- In Python, we can simply use the print() function to print output. For example
print('Python is my world')


Q14. What are operators in Python?
- In Python, operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.
There are different group of operators available:
1) Arithmetic Operator (+,-,*,/,%)
2) Assignment Operator (=,+=,-=,%=)
3) Comparison Operator (==,!=,<,>,>=)
4) Logical Operator    (and,or,not)


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
- Both of them are arithmatic operators
1) / is used for float division
e.g print(5/3) #gives o/p as 1.66

2) // is used for integer division
e.g print(5/3) #gives o/p as 1


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
- 
N= 'iNeuron'
print("Output=",N*4)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
-
Num = int(input("Please enter No.: "))
if (Num % 2 == 0):
   print("Number is Even")
else:
   print("Number is Odd")



Q18. What are boolean operator?
- There are three boolean operators that are used to compare values
1) and -> Returns true if both statements are true 
2) or -> Returns true if one of statements are true
3) not -> Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true ond vice versa
e.g.
Num1=12
Num2=5
print("Num1<10 and Num2<10 " , Num1<10 and Num2<10) #False
print("Num1>10 or Num2<10 " , Num1>10 or Num2<10) #True
print("not(Num1<10 and Num2<10) " , not(Num1<10 and Num2<10)) #True


Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
-
# Returns 1 if any one of operands is 1
print(1 or 0)  #o/p is 1
# Returns 1 only if both the operands are 1
print(0 and 0) #o/p is 0
#Returns true if all statements are true
print(True and False and True) #o/p is False
# Returns 1 if any one of operands is 1
print(1 or 0 or 0) #o/p is 1



Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
- Conditional statements are also known as decision-making statements. We need to use these conditional statements to execute the specific block of code if the given condition is true or false.
In Python we have the following statements:
1) If statements
2) If-else statements
3) Elif statements
4) Nested if and if-else statements



Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
- These are conditional statements and helful in decision making. We need to use these conditional statements to execute the specific block of code if the given condition is true or false.
e.g.
Marks = int(input("Enter Marks :"))
if Marks > 90:
    Print("A+")
elif Marks<90 and Marks>70:
    print("A")
elif Marks<70 and Marks>50:
    print("B+")
else: 
    print("B")



Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
-
Age = int(input("Please enter age : "))
if (Age >= 18):
   print("I can vote")

total = 0
r = 0 
while(r < len(list1)):
    if (list1[r] % 2 == 0):
        total = total + list1[r]

    r += 1
     
print("Sum of even numbers :", total)

    if (list1[r] > 500):
        break # Stop loop
    else:
        print("Number :", list1[r])
    r += 1




Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
- In Python, a string is an array of Unicode characters.Strings can be created by enclosing characters inside a single quote or double-quotes.
e.g 
a = "Python"
b = '1234'



Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
- Every character is accessable using index of that in string
e.g 
a= "Python"
print(a[0]) # will return P as result
print(a[-1]) # will return n as result



Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

print(x)

y = "Big Data iNeuron"
y = ''    # make varible y as empty string 
print(y)



Q32. What is escape sequence?
- An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
a = 'Python\nclass'  # will enter a new line
print(a)
b = 'Python\tclass'  # will enter tab space between Python and class
print(b)



Q33. How can you print the below string?
'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
-
b = "iNeuron's Big Data Course"
print(b)



Q34. What is a list in Python?
- A list in Python is used to store the sequence of various types of data. Python lists are mutable type its mean we can modify its element after it created. A list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas.
List = ['Python',123,30.5,True]



Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
- A list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas.
List = ['Python',123,30.5,True]



Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
- We can access the list items by referring to the index number
e.g 
List = ['Python',123,30.5,True]
print(List[0]) # will return 'Python'
print(List[2]) # will return 30.5



Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.
lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
-
# creating list
lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
print(lst[4][2])



Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
-
# creating list

print("Lenght of list :",len(lst))



Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
-
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst.insert(3,'Big')
print(lst)



Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
-
A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use round brackets, whereas lists use square brackets.



Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
-
A tuple is created by placing elements inside round brackets () , separated by commas.
T1 = ('Python',123,30.5,True)
T2 = ()   # Empty tuple



Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
- 
In Python, tuple is immutable i.e., you cannot add, change, or remove items (elements) in tuple .




Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
-
Tuple is immutable so you cannot add, change, or remove items (elements) in tuple.
However, we can concatenate two tuples
T2=(123,'abhi')
T1=(80,'python',23.32)
print(T1+T2)    # O/P --> (80, 'python', 23.32, 123, 'abhi')




Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
-
T1 = tuple(input("Please enter tuple elements seperated with space :").split())
print("Lenght of tuple :",len(T1))




Q45. What are sets in Python?
-
A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. Set are represented by { }




Q46. How can you create a set?
-
A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {} , separated by comma, or by using the built-in set() function.
S1 = set()   # Empty set
S2 = {123,'abc',30.5}



Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
-
S = set()
S.add('iNeuron')
print(S)




Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
-
S1 = set()  # creating empty set
S1.add('Python')
S1.add(123)
S1.add(30.5)
print(S1)




Q49. How is update() different from add()?
-
We use add() method to add single value to a set. We use update() method to add sequence values to a set.
S2 = {123,'abc',30.5}
tmp = {2,3,4,5,2,3}
S2.update(tmp)
print('Updated :',S2)




Q50. What is clear() in sets?
-
The clear() method removes all elements in a set.
S2 = {123,'abc',30.5}
S2.clear()
print(S2)   # return set()




Q51. What is frozen set?
-
Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.
S2 = {123,'Soni',123,30.5}
print(S2)
FS = frozenset(S2)
FS.add('xyz')   # not allowed




Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
-
Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.



Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
-
The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified sets.
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
set2 = {3,6,8,9,10}
# union operation
print(set1 | set2)




Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
-
The intersection() method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets.
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
set2 = {3,6,8,9,10}
# intersection operation
print(set1 & set2)




Q55. What is dictionary in Python?
-
In Python, a dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.




Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
-
Dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.




Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?
-
A dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’.
D = {}  #Empty dictionary
D1 = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}

D1 = {} 
D1['Key1']='Python'
D1['Key2']=5
print(D1)




Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
-
D1 = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
print(D1.values())




Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
-
D2 = {'Name':'Abhi','Key':{1:'HANA',2:'SQL'}}
print(D2['Key'])
print(D2['Key'][1])  # return HANA
print(D2['Key'][2])  # return SQL




Q62. What is the use of get() function?
-
The get() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.
e.g
D = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
print(D.get('Name'))   # return Abhi




Q63. What is the use of items() function?
-
The items() method returns a view object. The view object contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list.
e.g
D = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
print(D.items())




Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
-
The pop() method removes the specified item from the dictionary.The value of the removed item is the return value of the pop() method.
e.g
D1 = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
x= D1.pop('Age')     # remove item having key 'Age'
print(x)    




Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?
-
The popitem() method removes the item that was last inserted into the dictionary.
e.g
D2 = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
D2.popitem()
print(D2)




Q66. What is the use of keys() function?
-
The keys() method extracts the keys of the dictionary and returns the list of keys as a view object
e.g
D = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
print(D.keys())            # return dict_keys(['Name', 'Age'])




Q67. What is the use of values() function?
-
The values() method extracts the values of the dictionary and returns the list of values as a view object
e.g
D = {'Name':'Abhi','Age':30}
print(D.values())          # return dict_values(['Abhi', '30'])




Q68. What are loops in Python?
-
Looping means repeating something over and over until a particular condition is satisfied. A loop in Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied. Such a type of statement is also known as an iterative statement.




Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
-
In python, two major types of loops are FOR LOOPS and WHILE LOOPS.
# For loop
for num in range(0,11): #range(0,11) --> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    print(num)
# While loop
counter=1
while counter<=11: # Either True or False
    print(counter)
    counter+=1



Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
-
A For loop will run a preset number of times whereas a While loop will run a variable number of times.
For loops are used when you know how many times you want to run an algorithm before stopping.




Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
-
Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block from after the continue statement and forces the control to start the next iteration.
# Print numbers from list greater than 10
list4 = [1, 12, 5, 8, 10, 7, 11]
for num in list4:
    if (num <= 10):
        continue
    print("Numbers >10 :",num)




Q72. What is the use of break statement?
-
The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.
# Print first even number from list and exit
list3 = [1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 7, 11]
for num in list3:
    if(num%2==0):
        print('Even :',num)
        break




Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
-
The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
e.g 
list3 = [1, 3, 8, 10, 7, 11]
l=[]
for num in list3:
    if(num%2==0):
        pass
    else:
        l.append(num)
print('Odd number list :',l)




Q74. What is the use of range() function?
-
Python range() returns the sequence of numbers starting from a given start integer to a stop integer, which we can iterate using a for loop.
e.g
# For loop
for num in range(0,11): #range(0,11) --> [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    print(num)




Q75. How can you loop over a dictionary?
-
In Python, to iterate the dictionary with a for loop, use keys(), values(), items() methods. You can also get a list of all keys and values in the dictionary with those methods and list()
e.g
D1 = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 3}
for key,val in D1.items():
        print('key is :',key,', Value is :',val)
